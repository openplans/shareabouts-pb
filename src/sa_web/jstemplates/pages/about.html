<p>Through Participatory Budgeting, community members - like you - propose ideas and vote for how to spend at least $1,000,000 of the public budget in your Council District.</p>

<p>If you have an idea about how things could work better in your community, share it on the map below!</p>

<p>Your idea will be then reviewed, alongside all the others, based on its feasibility, the need it would address, and the number of people it would benefit.</p>

<p>The top projects will be put on a ballot, and next April, all residents of the {{ config.app.district }} Council District will be able vote on which to fund.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can post ideas, even if you don’t live in this Council District.</li>
<li>Eligible ideas must be for "capital" projects: physical infrastructure for public benefit, such as park improvements or new technology for schools. “Expense" projects, such as afterschool programs or expanding bus service, are not eligible. <a href="http://pps.org/placemap/pbnyc8/themes/pps/images/pbnyc_eligible-projects.jpg" title="">See examples</a>.</li>
<li>All ideas must be submitted by November 3rd, 2013</li>
