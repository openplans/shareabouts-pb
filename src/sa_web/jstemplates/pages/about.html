<h1>Real Power.</h1>

<p>Through Participatory Budgeting, community members - like you - propose ideas and vote for how to spend at least $1,000,000 of the public budget in your Council District.</p>

<p>If you have an idea about how things could work better in your community, share it on the map. <a href="/page/guidelines">Check out the guidelines</a> to see what ideas can be funded.</p>

<p>Your idea will be then reviewed, alongside all the others, based on its feasibility, the need it would address, and the number of people it would benefit.</p>

<p>The top projects will be put on a ballot, and next April, all residents of the {{ config.app.district }} Council District will be able vote on which to fund.</p>
